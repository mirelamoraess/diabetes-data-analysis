# Diabetes Data Analysis with Linear Regression

This project aims to explore and analyze diabetes data using Linear Regression. The dataset used is the Diabetes Dataset, available in the scikit-learn library.

## Objectives

- Load and explore the diabetes dataset.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train Linear Regression models with and without intercept.
- Evaluate the accuracy of the models on the training and testing sets.
- Compare the performance of the models using graphs.
  
## Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`: to load the dataset, train the Linear Regression models, and evaluate accuracy.
- `matplotlib`: to plot graphs showing the models' accuracy.
  
## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed in your environment. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage

The following code loads the dataset, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains Linear Regression models with and without intercept, evaluates accuracy, and plots the results.

## Expected Results

This project is expected to provide a practical understanding of how Linear Regression can be applied to diabetes data analysis and demonstrate how intercept affects model performance.
